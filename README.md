This project explores the Titanic dataset to perform data cleaning and EDA. It analyzes passenger demographics, survival rates, and factors influencing survival. Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are used for data manipulation, visualization, and insights extraction. Key steps include handling missing values, feature engineering, and visualizing relationships between variables to identify patterns and trends in the dataset.
